# SI Expansion 

The project is the process of finding the right location to expand to.

### Background

The company I work with has been dominating the sprinkler service industry in Colorado Springs for the last 10 years. The 5-year plan is to expand to another location in a simalar market. With Colorado having 511 zip codes the question is, "Where do we go next?"
